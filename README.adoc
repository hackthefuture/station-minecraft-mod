= Minecraft Mods Station

This repository is an attempt to create documentation and
manage resources for a Minecraft Mods station at
http://hackthefuture.org[Hack the Future] events.

This station had focused on modding Minecraft: Java Edition.
Starting with HtF 21 we've co-taught hacking Minecraft: Pi
Edition or its PC implementation (RaspberryJuice). This
allows use of Python and provides a much speedier setup,
and access to Minecraft 1.13 and above!
Read more about it on the
https://github.com/hackthefuture/station-raspberry-pi[**station-raspberry-pi**]
repo.

At the same time we still teach the Forge-based station
as it gives kids the freedom to modify mobs, textures,
and any other aspects of the game.

== System Requirements

Ideally a laptop to use with the Forge modding environment
should have at least

* a Core i7 CPU
* 8 GB of RAM

Compiling Java for such a large project can be CPU-intensive,
so a slower computer may result in much waiting throughout
each debug cycle. Furthermore, Forge has heavy memory
requirements, and a smaller physical RAM set may result
in less memory allocated to the JVM and obscure errors.

These problems are not insurmountable, but if you find
yourself with an underpowered machine at the Minecraft Mods
station, consider requesting a loaner laptop from the station
captain.

== Prerequisites

The following are recommended prerequisites for the Minecraft
Mods station. Mentors can help install them at the event.
However, if they are pre-installed, participants can get
started even faster.

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java JDK 8] (JDK 9, 10, and 11 are incompatible with ForgeGradle. Make sure you install JDK 8! Windows users: use the 64-bit JDK!)
* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition]
* https://files.minecraftforge.net/[Forge Mdk]

== Getting Started

Most of the lesson materials are currently stored on a Google
Drive folder. You can find recent versions of the above software,
as well as a `README.pdf` with screenshots of various hack ideas.

* https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3nL9cUsSr8-UmFYa19FVjFHQTA[Minecraft mods Gdrive folder] (`README.pdf` is here!)

Once you have a recent version of the JDK installed and the
Forge Mdk unzipped, run ForgeGradle via:

 gradlew setupDecompWorkspace idea

If you hit an error about incompatibility with Java 9 or above, you may
have to tell it explicitly to use your Java 8 installation. On Mac,
set this environment variable before rerunning `gradlew`:

 export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_???.jdk/Contents/Home

or on Windows:

 set JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_???"

If Java 11 was already installed, it often helps to just remove it. For example on macOS:

  cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines
  sudo rm -rf jdk1.11.*

This download-and-decompile step can take a while depending on
your internet connection and computer's horsepower.

Once it's done, make the bulk of the Minecraft source code available via:

 mv build/tmp/recompileMc/sources/net src/main/java/

If on Windows, use the `move` command and backslashes for the
path separators, i.e.

 move build\tmp\recompileMc\sources\net src\main\java\

From here you can launch IntelliJ IDEA, open up the project by
selecting your forge folder, and select *Build* ->
*Build Project*. The initial build ought to take a few minutes.

== Troubleshooting

If it fails after some error about the missing SDK, you probably
just need to select the SDK via the right drop-down in settings. See *`README.pdf`*!

Once in a while we encounter more obscure errors about missing
various Java libaries. Not every problem can be anticipated, so
if one laptop cannot seem to run Forge, this could be time for
a kid to try on RaspberryJuice (see https://github.com/hackthefuture/station-raspberry-pi[**station-raspberry-pi**])
or if lucky the station captain may have a spare laptop with
Forge set up and running.

If you've gotten this far, you've completed the bulk of the
"hurry up and wait" procedure. Congratulations! From here, the
ensuing steps may involve some troubleshooting but you'll no
longer need wait on compiling or decompiling an entire Minecraft
project.

== Start Modding

At this point you can begin hacking, in the sense of modifying
Minecraft code and testing the resultant changes.
If you're not sure what code to edit first, start with the
exercises below, or find even more examples in
*`README.pdf`* linked above.

== Exercises

We're in the process of migrating the examples from README.pdf to
markdown here on GitHub.

=== Creeper explosion radius

Find the **EntityCreeper** class under **net.minecraft.entity.monster**. Find the line where it specifies the explosion
radius. By default it will be three so try changing it to 30.

```java
    private int explosionRadius = 30;
```

then hit the Play button to start up Minecraft again, switch into survival mode, and trigger a creeper to make it explode.

=== Maximum knockback

Last time we made a change we had to restart the entire Minecraft engine. This time we'll make
use of the debugger with hot swapping. First close your existing Minecraft window and open
a new one using the Debug button (near the Play button, but looks like a bug). You can then open
up your world and walk around just as before.

The default maximum "knockback" enchantment allowed on an item is 2. Edit **EnchantmentKnockback** under
**net.minecraft.enchantment** and set this value to 100.

```java
    public int getMaxLevel() { return 100; }
```

This time, go to the Run -> Reload Changed Classes and you won't have to restart Minecraft!

Once this compiles, equip a diamond sword and run the commmand:
```
    /enchant Player<tab> 19 10
```

Note: The number 19 is the value for the knockback enchantment. Try out your sword to see any
difference in the knockback behavior.

This and other exercises are still in the original `*README.pdf*`. Open that up for more.

These tutorials have been used at past HtF events and may reference
Eclipse (another IDE) or older versions of Forge. With the help
of your mentors, however, these lessons can be readily adapted
to our modern environment.
